https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43228706/how-to-import-external-modules-in-riot-js/44578058#44578058 The problem is most likely that you're not using a build process. import statements are an ES6 feature and not yet supported in browsers. You'll need to use a transpiler (e.g. Babel JS, etc.) to transpile your ES6 code into ES5 that will be supported in the browser. If you're new to building javascript, you may have some issues with building Riot. My process uses Webpack, Babel, and Riot tag loader. The setup can be pretty difficult for beginners but it's easy to find some great resources and walkthroughs out there.
